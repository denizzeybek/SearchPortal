# SearchPortal

```
This application is a Search Portal.
This project's primary goal is to
create a search engine application.
You can search data with the user name property.
Ex: Brenden Martinez
There is no npm package.
Every component was created by VueJS manually.

In this application, data is kept on JSON-Server.
So it would be best if you ran JSON-Server to use
the application efficiently.
